# ü§ñ IMAGE GENERATION USING Denoising Diffusion Probability Model With learning rate warm-up and classifier-free guidance

## üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to the exploration of bipedal locomotion mastery in the Bipedal-Walking-v3 environment! This project encompasses the application of a modified Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm as a part of my Reinforcement Learning course, aiming to skillfully navigate through the challenges and complexities of bipedal movement.

## üìú Abstract from the Paper

> _"This paper proposes using a Denoising Diffusion Probability Model (DDPM) with learning rate warm-up and classifier-free guidance for image generation on CIFAR-10 and STL-10. The results demonstrate realistic and high-quality output, although hardware limitations made producing high-resolution images on the STL-10 dataset challenging. And the Future work could involve implementing the improved Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) to reduce the processing time and investing in a more advanced and stable hardware environment."_

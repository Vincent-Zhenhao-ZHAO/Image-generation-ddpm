# ü§ñ IMAGE GENERATION USING Denoising Diffusion Probability Model With learning rate warm-up and classifier-free guidance

## üöÄ Introduction

Image generation model via DDPM model on STL-10 and CIFAR-10 datasets

## üìú Abstract from the Paper

> _"This paper proposes using a Denoising Diffusion Probability Model (DDPM) with learning rate warm-up and classifier-free guidance for image generation on CIFAR-10 and STL-10. The results demonstrate realistic and high-quality output, although hardware limitations made producing high-resolution images on the STL-10 dataset challenging. And the Future work could involve implementing the improved Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) to reduce the processing time and investing in a more advanced and stable hardware environment."_
